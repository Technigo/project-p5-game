# Ziko's "Guess Who?" Game

This is a JavaScript project where we were to build a Guess Who game, with a board of different people with different attributes. The player may guess on a character at once, or guess on attributes to filter out the remaining characters before committing to their final character.

The JacaScript logic was the highlight and what was needed to be built, as structure and styling was provided.

## The problem

We had a few pointers as to how the flow was expected to work, from drawing the board until the final guess with results.

One step at a time, I worked on getting the proper functions to work with the correct attributes and/or values, and pass it along in an unbroken chain. However, the player may want to restart the game and/or play again, so a function for that also had to be incorporated to make it more alive.

Main focus came to be filtering out the array to make sure player guesses matched with the elusive secret character. Naturally, this had to be presented correctly throughout playing.

If I had more time I would probably exchange the characters for something less of a 'Guess Who default', maybe dogs or as smaller modules to learn a certain subjects; 'Guess the Element', 'Guess the City' etc. And lastly try to make the drawing of the board/cards fade in or out; smoother transitions.
